# What is a Rules Engine

A rule engine is basically a set of tools that enable developers to build decision logic based on the data. The rule engine applies rules and actions as defined by end users without affecting how the application runs. So its like you do not need to deploy/build your code again again, you just add/update rules as per the data and the business logic remains same !

## Required Jars

All the required jars have been attached inside the folder- https://github.com/amanscode/rulesengine/tree/main/rulesengine/required_jars

## Example in this repository

A price to discount calculator is there which fetches the percentage of discount as per the price range from the set of rules defined in the XML file.
Run the Example1.java file directly. This uses rules defined in the example1.xml file. You may need to provide the right path of this xml file in the Example1.java file.
